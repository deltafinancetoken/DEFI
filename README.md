# DEFI
“We believe through the power of collective decentralization we can build something stronger than a centralized team ever could create. A communityrun token is nothing without the united individuals who give it purpose.” Delta Finance wasn’t just a name selected by some random singular person or a group of persons with supreme rights but was actually selected through a rigorous polling proccess from many names suggested by our community in our Discord server and to our surprice and utter coincidence our selected project name's initials matched with DEFI which also represents on how decentralised we are. For many it became part of their username, their handle, and their avatars/profile pictures which they switched to our adorable Delta sporting a beret. Whether you are a new recruit or part of the old guard, if you fly under the Deltab banner, you must embrace our founding principles:
1. We started from zero, to zero. It’s the spirit of our project to create something out of nothing.
2. We were not founded from an existing community, let alone a preassembled team. The brilliant minds behind Delta had never collaborated before. They were a fresh team of developers, designers, moderators, marketers, and shillers. When you joined the Delta army, from anywhere in the world, you found where your talents could be used best (throught our unbiased and stringent interview process), and got to work.
